# 🚀 QUICK START GUIDE - Music Bingo Prototype

Welcome! This guide will get you up and running in under 10 minutes.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies (2 minutes)

Open terminal and navigate to the project:

```bash
cd /Users/1di/Music_Bingo/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs:
- `fpdf2` - For generating PDF bingo cards
- `requests` - For fetching songs from iTunes

## Step 2: Generate Song Pool (2-3 minutes)

```bash
python generate_pool.py
```

**What this does:**
- Fetches 250+ popular songs from iTunes
- Gets 30-second preview URLs
- Creates `data/pool.json`

**Expected output:**
```
🎵 Starting iTunes song pool generation...
Target: 250 songs

✓ Fetched 45/50 songs from 'top hits 2024'
✓ Fetched 42/50 songs from 'top hits 2023'
...
✓ Pool generation complete!
Total songs: 267
```

## Step 3: Generate Bingo Cards (30 seconds)

```bash
python generate_cards.py
```

**What this does:**
- Creates 50 unique 5×5 bingo cards
- Generates `data/cards/music_bingo_cards.pdf`
- Cards are ready to print on A4 paper

**Expected output:**
```
🎴 Generating 50 bingo cards...
  Generated 10/50 cards...
  Generated 20/50 cards...
  ...
✓ PDF generated successfully!
  File: data/cards/music_bingo_cards.pdf
  Size: 2.34 MB
```

## Step 4: Configure ElevenLabs API (2 minutes)

### Get Your API Key

1. Go to: https://elevenlabs.io/
2. Sign up (free tier is fine for testing)
3. Go to Profile → API Key
4. Copy your API key (starts with `sk_`)

### Add to Code

Edit `frontend/game.js` (line 19):

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    ELEVENLABS_API_KEY: 'sk_paste_your_key_here',  // ← Add your key
    VOICE_ID: '21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM',  // British male voice
    // ...
};
```

**Save the file!**

## Step 5: Test the Game (1 minute)

1. Open `frontend/game.html` in Chrome/Firefox/Safari
2. Click anywhere on the page (unlocks audio)
3. Press "NEXT SONG" button
4. You should hear:
   - AI voice announcing a song
   - 5-second preview of the song

**Success indicators:**
- Status shows: "🎙️ Announcing..." then "🎵 Playing song preview..."
- Called songs list updates
- Statistics update (1 called, X remaining)

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Your Music Bingo system is now fully functional.

### Next Steps

**For Testing:**
- Print a few bingo cards (`data/cards/music_bingo_cards.pdf`)
- Try playing a full round with friends
- Test custom announcements

**For Production:**
- Read `docs/SETUP.md` for deployment instructions
- Read `docs/USAGE.md` for pub operation guide
- Read `docs/API_KEYS.md` for detailed API configuration

**For Live Event:**
1. Print 50+ bingo cards
2. Connect laptop to sound system
3. Open `frontend/game.html`
4. Press "NEXT SONG" every 15-20 seconds
5. Verify winners against called songs list

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" error
```bash
pip install fpdf2 requests
```

### "pool.json not found"
```bash
cd backend
python generate_pool.py
```

### "ElevenLabs API error: 401"
- Check API key is correct in `game.js`
- Ensure no extra spaces
- Key should start with `sk_`

### No sound playing
1. Click anywhere on page first
2. Check laptop volume
3. Check browser console (F12) for errors

### Songs won't load
- Check internet connection (iTunes API needs internet)
- Verify `data/pool.json` exists
- Try refreshing the page
